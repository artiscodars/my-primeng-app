## Button Types

### Basic Types

- **Primary**: Used for the most important action, typically a "call to action" (CTA) that we want the user to perform, such as creating a new item.
- **Secondary**: Used for less critical actions, often for optional actions, such as opening an important section.
- **Success**: Typically used for actions like saving data or confirming a successful operation.
- **Danger**: Used for actions that might have negative consequences, such as deleting data.
- **Link**: Used to make a button like simple link.

### Usage Recommendations

- **Primary**: For the main action, like "Create new" (CTA - "primary call to action").
- **Secondary**: For secondary actions that are less critical, often used for optional tasks.
- **Success**: Typically used for "Save" buttons.

## Button States

- **Default**: The normal state of the button.
- **Hover**: When the button is hovered over with a mouse.
- **Pressed**: When the button is being clicked or tapped.
- **Focused**: When the button is focused for accessibility or keyboard navigation.
- **Disabled**: Should be avoided; it is better to hide the button until the action is allowed.

## Buttons with Icons

Buttons can include icons to enhance their meaning and provide additional context.

## Button Text Guidelines

- Should be clear and understandable.
- Follow a consistent text concept, for example:
  - Continue/Next/Forward
  - OK/Save
  - Create/Add
- Refer to examples and functionality, such as:

  - [HoP Research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14NwRoQT188yO2Yb9VqvZeLrFxy5ODtnWPtw2plodOI4/edit?usp=sharing)
- The button text should specify the exact action that will occur.

## Recommended Button Texts

To ensure accessibility, use ARIA text for clarity.

- **Add**: To add an entry, row, or user.
- **Create**: To create a document or user.

When naming buttons, use specific actions:

- **OK**: Usually paired with "Cancel".
- **Cancel**: Typically paired with "OK" or "Save".
- **Save**: Generally paired with "Cancel".
- **Delete**: Use specifically for deletion actions.
- **Send**: Use specifically for sending actions.
- **Close**: Avoid if possible.
- **Stay**: Avoid if possible.
- **Yes/No**: Avoid if possible.
- **Return**: Avoid if possible.
- **Continue**: To proceed with a process.
- **Next/Previous**: To navigate between steps.
